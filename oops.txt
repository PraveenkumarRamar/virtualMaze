OOP in JavaScript (Object-oriented Programming)

Encapsulation:
-Adding the data  into an object is Encapsulation

eg: Person={
    name:"Praveen",
    age:23,
    address:{
        from:"Salem",
        state:"Tamilnadu"
    },
    interst:["coding","debugging","driving"]
    isAlive:True
}

Creating a function into an object is called method
eg:
person{
    name:"Praveen",
    age:23,

    greeting(){
        This is method
    }
}


Factory function(camelCase myFirstName)
--Creating

Constructor (PascalCase : MyFirstName)
Constructing a things

new = new is a keyword it creating an empty object
this keyword = the key means an empty object
1.Calling this keyword in method refers to an Object

2.Calling this keyword in a function refers to global 
in browser it refers to the window, nodeJs it refers to global

Dynamic Objects

let Person = {
    name:"Praveen"
}
Person.age = 22
Person.greeting = function(){}

delete Person.name
